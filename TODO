* return callable's return value via some magic

  This is already works for normal run but doesn't work for
  collect_only mode. Instead of faking a syscall (0xbadca11) we need
  to find a better way to communicate with the parent. (abstract
  domain sockets?)

* check that dir exists for mkdir EEXIST case, write complete test
* implement action=log/deny/stop argument, write a test case
* reactivate chown/chmod log code
* allow optional logging of read accesses
* need ability to whitelist at least reading of some files
* anything else? :)
